*** Required for Vmware Tools to Work! ***

INSTALL VMWARE TOOLS
Login to the guest as root
Click the VM menu (Press [CTRL] and [ALT] to get your cursor back)
Click Guest
Click Install/Upgrade VMware Tools
Back at the root prompt, type: mkdir /mnt/cdrom
Type: mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
* NOTE: if this is not a new server and you are upgrading tools, be sure to delete any old copies of /tmp/vmware-tools-distrib before proceeding *
Type: cd /tmp
Type: tar zxpf /mnt/cdrom/VMwareTools-x.x.x-yyyy.tar.gz
(where the x.x.x-yyyy is the version of Vmware Tools you are installing)
Type: umount /dev/cdrom
(leave the /mnt/cdrom folder… you might want it later)
Type: /tmp/vmware-tools-distrib/vmware-install.pl
Unless you really know what you are doing… 
ACCEPT the defaults for EVERYTHING… just keep pressing [ENTER]!
This will also kick off /usr/bin/vmware-config-tools.pl for you!
Again, just press [ENTER] until it finishes)
Reboot the server by typing: shutdown -r now
Once it reboots, and if you did everything correctly, you should see General status information appear in the guest’s Summary tab.
– SSH LOGIN –… we can use it now.

CHANGE THE DEFAULT PROMPT (System Wide)
* NOTE: Remember that the letter i for Insert mode, [ESC] to go back to command mode, and :wq to Write and Quit the file. *
* NOTE: If you ever want to quit without making changes, type: :q!
(colon, the letter q, the exclamation point [or bang as it is sometimes called])
Login as root
Type: vi /etc/profile
Look for the following:
if [ -x /usr/bin/id ]; then
    if [ -z "$EUID" ]; then
        # ksh workaround
        EUID=`id -u`
        UID=`id -ru`
    fi
    USER="`id -un`"
    LOGNAME=$USER
    MAIL="/var/spool/mail/$USER"
fi
After the USER line, add UNAME=”`id -gn`” so it looks like:
if [ -x /usr/bin/id ]; then
    if [ -z "$EUID" ]; then
        # ksh workaround
        EUID=`id -u`
        UID=`id -ru`
    fi
    USER="`id -un`"
    UNAME="`id -gn`"
    LOGNAME=$USER
    MAIL="/var/spool/mail/$USER"
fi
After editing, press [ESC]
Type: :w
(the colon, the letter w)
Continuing in /etc/profile, look for the following:
unset i
unset pathmunge
Insert the following text BEFORE the two unset lines so it looks like:
# Setting the default prompt
PS1='\n$UNAME@`hostname -s` | \d @ \t \n$PWD> '

echo
echo -----------------------------------------------------------
echo See who else is logged in to the server
who
echo
echo See your tty
who am i
echo -----------------------------------------------------------
echo

unset i
unset pathmunge
After editing, press [ESC]
Type: :wq
(the colon, the letter w, the letter q)
To test, open a NEW (do not close the current) SSH session to see if the settings worked.
The new login sequence should look something like (from a Mac):
MYWORKSTATION$ ssh root@10.108.10.10
root@192.168.1.2's password: 
Last login: Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 2014 from 192.168.1.200

-----------------------------------------------------------
See who else is logged in to the server
root     pts/0        2014-01-01 00:00 (192.168.1.200)
root     pts/1        2014-01-01 00:00 (192.168.1.200)

See your tty
root     pts/1        2014-01-01 00:00 (192.168.1.200)
-----------------------------------------------------------


root@192.168.1.2 | Mon Jan 01 @ 00:00:00 
/root>
The first section shows who is currently logged in to the server and only comes up on initial login
The second section is a two line command prompt that always shows:
user@server | [Day] [Mon] [Date] @ [HH:MM:SS]
[Current Path]>

– SSH LOGIN –
We can use this from here on out!

SET YOUR TIME ZONE
Login as root
Type: mv /etc/localtime /etc/localtime.bu
Type: ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime

(Change to match your time zone)
To verify, type ls -la /etc/local*
Your output should look similar to the following:

lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   36 Jan 01 00:00 localtime -> /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 3519 Jan 01 00:00 localtime.bu
CONFIGURE TIME AND NTP (Client and Server)
* NOTE: Remember that the letter i for Insert mode, [ESC] to go back to command mode, and :wq to Write and Quit the file. *
* NOTE: If you ever want to quit without making changes, type: :q!
(colon, the letter q, the exclamation point [or bang as it is sometimes called])
Login as root
Type: yum -y install ntp ntpdate
Type: ntpdate 129.6.15.28
(129.6.15.28 is time-a.nist.gov, use a location appropriate time server)
Type: vi /etc/ntp.conf
If you want to make this a server, add something similar to the following:
# Allow ALL hosts from ANY private (not Internet routable) IP Subnet
restrict 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 nomodify notrap
restrict 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 nomodify notrap
Add location appropriate time servers to the configuration file:
# Use public servers from the pool.ntp.org project.
# Please consider joining the pool (http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html).
# time-a.nist.gov
server 129.6.15.28
# time-b.nist.gov
server 129.6.15.29
# server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
# server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
# server 2.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
# server 3.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
* NOTE: You can also remark out CentOS time server lines if you want. *

After editing, press [ESC]
Type: :wq
(the colon, the letter w, the letter q)
Type: chkconfig ntpd on
Type: service ntpd start
Verify time is synchronized by typing: ntpstat
Your input/output should be similar to the following:
[root@myserver ~]# ntpstat
synchronised to NTP server (129.6.15.28) at stratum 2 
   time correct to within 103 ms
   polling server every 64 s
CONFIGURE ROOT’S MAIL DESTINATION
* NOTE: Remember that the letter i for Insert mode, [ESC] to go back to command mode, and :wq to Write and Quit the file. *
* NOTE: If you ever want to quit without making changes, type: :q!
(colon, the letter q, the exclamation point [or bang as it is sometimes called])
Login as root
Type: vi /etc/aliases
Scroll down (or press [CTRL] and [F]) until you see something like:
# Person who should get root's mail
#root:          marc
Add a new line directly under #root so the file looks something like:
# Person who should get root's mail
#root:          marc
root:		myemail@mydomain.com
After editing, press [ESC]
Type: :wq
(the colon, the letter w, the letter q)
To enable the changes, type: newaliases
Send a test message by typing the following:
/bin/mail -s "Test Message" "myemail@mydomain.com" < /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
CONFIGURE AUTOMATIC UPDATES FOR THE SERVER
THIS IS A SPECIAL MODE OF VI… BE CAREFUL… 
TYPING SOMETHING WRONG COULD ERASE YOUR CRON!!!
* NOTE: Remark lines start with a # symbol and are ignored by cron. *
* NOTE: Remember that the letter i for Insert mode, [ESC] to go back to command mode, and :wq to Write and Quit the file. *
* NOTE: If you ever want to quit without making changes, type: :q!
(colon, the letter q, the exclamation point [or bang as it is sometimes called])
Login as root
Type: crontab -e
Insert the following:
# ##########################################
# Automatic Updates
# 12 noon, every Sunday
# The -y means YES to EVERYTHING!
# ##########################################
0 12 * * 0 yum -y update
After editing, press [ESC]
Type: :wq
(the colon, the letter w, the letter q)
To verify your settings were accepted, type: crontab -l
(lower case L at the end)
In general, the syntax for cron is as follows:
#        crontab [-u user] [ -e | -l | -r ]
#                (default operation is replace, per 1003.2)
#       -e       (edit user's crontab)
#       -l       (list user's crontab)
#       -r       (delete user's crontab)
#       -i       (prompt before deleting user's crontab)
#       -s       (selinux context)
#
# * * * * * Command
# | | | | |
# | | | | +--------- Day of the Week, 0 - 6, 0=Sunday
# | | | +----------- Month, 1 - 12
# | | +------------- Day of the Month, 1 - 31, Only if valid date
# | +--------------- Hour, 0 - 23
# +----------------- Minute, 0 - 59
#
# Repeat pattern like */2 for every 2 minutes or */10 for every 10 minutes. 
# This is not supported by all operating systems.
#
# Use multiple values in a field by separating them with commas.  In the 
# month field use 1,6,12 to run a job every January, June, and December.
#
# Use multiple values in a field by separating them with a dash.  In the
# Day of the Week field use 1-5 to run a job only during week days.
#
# The specification of days can be made in two fields: month day and 
# weekday.  If both are specified in an entry, they are cumulative meaning 
# both of the entries will get executed.
That is it for now… you should have a fully operational (though maybe not so secure) guest CentOS 6.5 installation.
